	The 50-30-20 rule: the basics of budgeting
	It may sound like another dietary fad, but 50-30-20 is about getting your finances, rather than your body, into shape. A useful rule of thumb, popularised by a range of online money guides, is the 50-30-20 rule. According to the rule: 50% of your income after tax should go to needs, such as your mortgage or rent, food, utilities, commuting costs, insurance, minimum monthly debt repayments and childcare; 30% to flexible expenses – your wants or “nice-to-haves” – which may include streaming subscriptions, flat whites and holidays and whatever else gives you pleasure; and 20% set aside for savings, investments and additional payments to reduce debt (on top of your minimum monthly debt repayments – which come out of needs). </section>
